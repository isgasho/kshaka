/*
Package kshaka is a pure Go implementation of the CASPaxos consensus protocol.
It's name is derived from the Kenyan hip hop group, Kalamashaka.

"CASPaxos is a replicated state machine (RSM) protocol. Unlike Raft and Multi-Paxos,
it doesn’t use leader election and log replication, thus avoiding associated complexity.
Its symmetric peer-to-peer approach achieves optimal commit latency in wide-area networks
and doesn’t cause transient unavailability when any [N−1] of N nodes crash." - [The CASPaxos whitepaper](https://github.com/rystsov/caspaxos/blob/master/latex/caspaxos.pdf)

TODO: add system design here.

// Node represents an entity that is both a Proposer and an Acceptor.
// This is the thing that users who depend on this library will be creating and interacting with.
// A node is typically a server but it can also represent anything else you want.

	id uint64
