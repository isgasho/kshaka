# Kshaka

Kshaka is a Go implementation of the [CASPaxos](https://github.com/rystsov/caspaxos/blob/master/latex/caspaxos.pdf) consensus protocol.                              
It's name is derived from Kenyan hip hop group, Kalamashaka.                
>CASPaxos is a replicated state machine (RSM) protocol. Unlike Raft and Multi-Paxos, it doesn’t use leader election and log replication, thus avoiding associated complexity.                   
Its symmetric peer-to-peer approach achieves optimal commit latency in wide-area networks and doesn’t cause transient unavailability when any ⌊N−1⌋ of N nodes crash." - [The CASPaxos whitepaper](https://github.com/rystsov/caspaxos/blob/master/latex/caspaxos.pdf)
